			<![CDATA[

        This version uses 2018-05-01 BatchAI API specification which introduced the following braking changes:
        1. Clusters, FileServers must be created under a workspace;
        2. Jobs must be created under an experiment;
        3. Clusters, FileServers and Jobs do not accept location during creation and belong to the same location as the parent workspace;
        4. Clusters, FileServers and Jobs do not support tags;
        5. BatchAIManagementClient.usage renamed to BatchAIManagementClient.usages;
        6. Job priority changed a type from int to an enum;
        7. File.is_directory is replaced with File.file_type;
        8. Job.priority and JobCreateParameters.priority is replaced with scheduling_priority;
        9. Removed unsupported MountSettings.file_server_type attribute;
        10. OutputDirectory.type unsupported attribute removed;
        11. OutputDirectory.create_new attributes removed, BatchAI will always create output directories if they not exist;
        12. SetupTask.run_elevated attribute removed, the setup task is always executed under root.

        Features:
        1. Added support to workspaces to group Clusters, FileServers and Experiments and remove limit on number of allocated resources;
        2. Added support for experiment to group jobs and remove limit on number of jobs;
